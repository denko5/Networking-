          <p3> <b><u>RAM (Random Access Memory) </u></b><br><ol><li>is the internal memory of the CPU for storing data, program, and program result. It is a read/write memory which stores data until the machine is working. As soon as the machine is switched off, data is erased.</li></ol><br>

<b><u>Primary Memory</u></b><br>
<ol>
  <li>Access time in RAM is independent of the address, that is, each storage location inside the memory is as easy to reach as other locations and takes the same amount of time. Data in the RAM can be accessed randomly but it is very expensive.</li>

<li>RAM is volatile, i.e. data stored in it is lost when we switch off the computer or if there is a power failure. Hence, a backup Uninterruptible Power System (UPS) is often used with computers. RAM is small, both in terms of its physical size and in the amount of data it can hold.</li>
</ol>


<u><b>RAM is of two types −</b></u>
<ol>

<li>Static RAM (SRAM)</li>
<li>Dynamic RAM (DRAM)</li>
</ol>

          <b><u>What is a router?</u></b><br>
          <ol>
<li>A router is a piece of network hardware responsible for forwarding packets to their destination.</li> <li>Routers connect to two or more IP networks or subnetworks and pass data packets between them as needed</li>
<li>Routers are used in homes and offices for setting up local network connections. More powerful routers operate all over the Internet, helping data packets reach their destinations.</li></ol>
<br>
<b><u>What is routing?</u></b>
<ol>
<li><a href="#">Network routing</a> is the process of selecting a path across one or more networks. </li>
<li>The principles of routing can apply to any type of network, from telephone networks to public transportation.</li>
<li>In packet-switching networks, such as the Internet, routing selects the paths for Internet Protocol (IP) packets to travel from their origin to their destination.</li>
<li>These Internet routing decisions are made by specialized pieces of network hardware called routers.</li>

          <summary><b>SWITCH</b></summary>
          <b><u>Features of Switches</u></b>
          <ol>
<li>A switch operates in the layer 2, i.e. data link layer of the OSI model.</li>

<li>It is an intelligent network device that can be conceived as a multiport network bridge.</li>

<li>It uses MAC addresses (addresses of medium access control sublayer) to send data packets to selected destination ports.</li>

<li>It uses packet switching technique to receive and forward data packets from the source to the destination device.</li>

<li>It is supports unicast (one-to-one), multicast (one-to-many) and broadcast (one-to-all) communications.</li>

<li>Transmission mode is full duplex, i.e. communication in the channel occurs in both the directions at the same time. Due to this, collisions do not occur.</li>

<li>Switches are active devices, equipped with network software and network management capabilities.</li>

<li>Switches can perform some error checking before forwarding data to the destined port.</li>

<li>The number of ports is higher – 24/48</li>

          <summary><b>FIREWALL</b></summary><b><u>Introduction of Firewall in Computer Network</u></b><br>
          <ol>
A <a href="#">firewall</a> is a network security device, either hardware or software-based, which monitors all incoming and outgoing traffic and based on a defined set of security rules it accepts, rejects or drops that specific traffic.</ol>
<ol><li><b>Accept : </b>allow the traffic</li>
<li><b>Reject: </b>block the traffic but reply with an “unreachable error”</li>
<li><b>Drop :</b> block the traffic with no reply</li>
</ol>

<b><u>NB:</u></b><i>A firewall establishes a barrier between secured internal networks and outside untrusted network, such as the InternetTypes of Firewall</i><br>
<ol>

<b>Firewalls are generally of two types: Host-based and Network-based.</b>

<li><b>Host- based Firewalls :</b> Host-based firewall is installed on each network node which controls each incoming and outgoing packet. It is a software application or suite of applications, comes as a part of the operating system. Host-based firewalls are needed because network firewalls cannot provide protection inside a trusted network. Host firewall protects each host from attacks and unauthorized access.</li>
<li><b>Network-based Firewalls :</b> Network firewall function on network level. In other words, these firewalls filter all incoming and outgoing traffic across the network. It protects the internal network by filtering the traffic using rules defined on the firewall. A Network firewall might have two or more network interface cards (NICs). A network-based firewall is usually a dedicated system with proprietary software installed.</li>

          <summary><b>DOMAIN NAME</b></summary><b><u>What is a domain name?</u></b>
          <ol>
A <a href="#">domain name</a> is your website name. A domain name is the address where Internet users can access your website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of number. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses.</ol>
